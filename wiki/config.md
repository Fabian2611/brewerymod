## Config
This mod has a config file that allows you to change some settings.
This file has an overview of all available settings and their default values.

### Config Location
The config file is located in the `config` folder of your Minecraft instance, named `brewery-common.toml`.

### Config Options
- `useBuiltinBrews (boolean)`: 
  - **Default**: `true`
  - **Description**: This setting determines whether the mod should use the built-in brews or not. If set to `false`, only custom brews defined in datapacks will be used. This is useful if you want to create a completely custom brewing experience without the built-in brews.
