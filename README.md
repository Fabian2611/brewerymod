## Brewery
Brewery is a simple Minecraft Mod using the Forge modloader that adds a brewing system to the game.
It is heavily inspired by the Spigot Plugin [Brewery](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/brewery.3082/) and its still actively maintained fork [BreweryX](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/breweryx.114777/).

## Issues
If you find any bugs or issues, please report them on the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/Fabian2611/brewerymod/issues/).
You can also use the Issues page to suggest new features or improvements, but I can not guarantee that I will implement them.

## Versions
Currently, this mod is only available for Minecraft 1.20.1 using Forge 47.4.0.
I do not plan on updating or backporting this mod to other Minecraft versions.
I do not plan on porting this mod to NeoForge, Fabric, Quilt or any other modloader.
I do not even plan on porting this mod to different Forge loader versions.
**If you plan on doing any of the above, feel free to do so.**
